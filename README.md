This is a simple reservation tool for learning spaces in a two-floored building, including a GUI for input.
The seat map can have any shape and is loaded from the the two CSV files "seats1.csv" and "seats.cv".


The main functions are the manual reservation tool,the automatic seat assignment tool, the reservation cancellation and the display of the floor plan with the current seat status.
An admin can also reset the floor plan after entering the admin password.

The reservation tool has been programmed using Python. Tkinter has been used for the GUI.
To run the reservation tool, execute the "Seat Reservation Tool.py" file.

The seat reservation tool has been programmed by Jan Gwerder, Katharina Haglund, Luca Hartmann and Roberto Pompeo and for the course Programming with Advanced Computer Languages @ HSG
